# DVRIPClient - Client for various Surveillance cameras and DVR's operating under the DVR-IP protocol, also known as NetSurveillance or Sofia


This is My first project that I've built thats based on ES6 from ground up. I probably did some things wrong-ish. Also my first project where I've used JSDoc extensively, but from what I can tell I've done everything mostly correct.

As it stands, I've implemented only the things that *I* needed, as well as most easily implementable ones. If you're missing a certain function call feel free to add it in and submit a PR! :D

## TODO
- Generate Wiki using JSDoc comments
- Add tests
